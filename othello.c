/* Programming project 1: Write the Lisp equivalent to the C code that follows, plus any improvements. In particular, follow the guidelines of items (0) - (3) below.
   GIVE YOUR NAME HERE:
   There are 4 deliverables as given below. Declare any source of help that you received here and explain the nature of 
   the help. Cite all sources of ideas and implementation details (including books, 
   other students, TA, instructor, etc):
   (1) Produce Lisp code equivalent to the C code of this file; Your 
       translation should insure that each of the Lisp STRATEGY functions
       (i.e., human, randomstrategy, ..., maxweighteddiffstrategy5) 
       return and integer value with an integer as first argument and
       and integer array (representing a board) as a second argument.
       A call to the Lisp (equivalent) Roundrobin function should produce
       results like those shown at the bottom of this file for the
       minmax results. This straightforward translation of the C code as is, 
       together with the results of Roundrobin is deliverable 1.
   (2) modify function minmax, minchoice, and maxchoice to implement
       alpha beta pruning. You may modify function minmax, but not
       minmax's function prototype. You may modify the function 
       prototypes of minchoice and maxchoice, as well as modifying
       their internal mechanisms. See the header comments that precede 
       these functions.
       Search the text for   int minmax    to find these functions. The 
       entire file, with modified code to implement alpha beta pruning,
       the results of Roundrobin, and a 1 page written summary of the 
       differences in performance, are deliverable 2.
   
   (3) Modify function minmax to select randomly among the best moves
       as determined by minmax search with alpha beta pruning.
       That is, several moves may have the best score. Select randomly
       from among these without compromising the advantages of
       alpha-beta pruning.
   (4) Add any additional strategies that you wish. Thoroughly document
       their operation in comments, with references as appropriate, and
       document any changes to other aspects of the Othello functions
       that were required by the new strategies. Add your new strategies, 
       if any, to the roundrobin array and instrument the code so that wins,
       losses, and generated boards are printed in comparison to other
       strategies. You may work on this part as part of a team of up to three.

/* This code is a translation of Norvig's (1992) LISP implementation, though it deviates from it in several respects. In theory you might be able to track down this code and turn much of it in to satisfy the project requirements, but consistent with the honor code (and ethics generally), you would declare this use and would receive a MUCH reduced grade.

/*     How to play the Game of Othello    
   Othello is a game between two players on an 8x8 square grid
   (64 positions). The two players, represented as black (b)
   and white (w), initially occupy the center positions as
   indicated below.
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1  . . . . . . . . 
2  . . . . . . . . 
3  . . . . . . . . 
4  . . . w b . . . 
5  . . . b w . . . 
6  . . . . . . . . 
7  . . . . . . . . 
8  . . . . . . . . 
  Black moves first, and places a 'b' somewhere on an *empty* location
  (indicated by a '.'). There are constraints on where the b may be
  placed though (other than 'empty'). Notably, the b must be placed
  so that it brackets or sandwiches a contiguous sequence of
  opponent pieces. So, a b can be placed at coordinates (3,4), (4,3), (5,6),
  or (6,5). When a b is placed that causes a sequence of ws to be bracketed,
  the ws that are bracketed are flipped to b (i.e., from the opponent's
  color to the current player's color). So, placing a 'b' at (5,6)
  leads to the following board:
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1  . . . . . . . . 
2  . . . . . . . . 
3  . . . . . . . . 
4  . . . w b . . . 
5  . . . b b b . . 
6  . . . . . . . . 
7  . . . . . . . . 
8  . . . . . . . . 
  White now moves. Any move must bracket at least one b piece,
  and after doing so, the bs in the bracketed sequence are
  switched to ws. For the board above, w could be placed on (6,4),
  (4,6), or (6,6) -- note that one can bracket pieces along a
  diagnoal. If w is placed on (6,6), the resulting board is:
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1  . . . . . . . . 
2  . . . . . . . . 
3  . . . . . . . . 
4  . . . w b . . . 
5  . . . b w b . . 
6  . . . . . w . . 
7  . . . . . . . . 
8  . . . . . . . . 
Play continues:
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8      b to (4,3)
1  . . . . . . . . 
2  . . . . . . . . 
3  . . . . . . . . 
4  . . b b b . . . 
5  . . . b w b . . 
6  . . . . . w . . 
7  . . . . . . . . 
8  . . . . . . . . 
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8      w to (5,3)
1  . . . . . . . . 
2  . . . . . . . . 
3  . . . . . . . . 
4  . . b b b . . . 
5  . . w w w b . . 
6  . . . . . w . . 
7  . . . . . . . . 
8  . . . . . . . . 
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8      b to (6,5). Notice that this brackets
1  . . . . . . . .      a white piece along a vertical AND diagonal
2  . . . . . . . .      path, causing both sequences to be switched 
3  . . . . . . . .      to b
4  . . b b b . . . 
5  . . w b b b . . 
6  . . . . b w . . 
7  . . . . . . . . 
8  . . . . . . . . 
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8      w to (3,3). Again, this brackets b along 
1  . . . . . . . .      two sequences. In general, all bracketed
2  . . . . . . . .      sequences (there may by many) are
3  . . w . . . . .      swaped to the current players color.
4  . . w w b . . . 
5  . . w b w b . . 
6  . . . . b w . . 
7  . . . . . . . . 
8  . . . . . . . . 
Play continues until neither player can move. Very often, this
happens when all sqaures are filled, but both players may
be unable to bracket a sequence of opponents' pieces before all
squares are filled, and so the game stops before all squares
are filled. The player with the most squares filled at game's
end, wins.
If one player cannot move (because they cannot bracket an opposing
sequence), but the other player can move, then the former player
must pass until such time that they can move.
Note that when running the program, where one of the players is human,
a board will be printed as follows:
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
10  . . . . . . . .    Specify a move by the sum of the appropriate 
20  . . . . . . . .    row and column. So, for example, 42 would be a 
30  . . w . . . . .    legal move for black. If you specify an illegal
40  . . w w b . . .    move (e.g., 23 in this example), you will
50  . . w b w b . .    be prompted for another move.
60  . . . . b w . . 
70  . . . . . . . . 
80  . . . . . . . .

easily into a single function, finding the board
with minimum score, s, is equivalent to finding the board
with maximum -1 * s. One would have to add an additional
parameter to decide whether to multiply by a -1 factor or
not in computing a board score in this combined function.
With a bit more work, one could combine all three
functions, minmax, maxchoice, and minchoice, into a single

What is interesting about this last game is that BLACK leads
by a large number of squares until near the very end of the game.
Remember that in this latter game, white is doing 5 ply lookahead
and is generating something on the order of 2.5 million boards
per game (look at the diff/1 vs. wdiff/5 line below under
roundrobin results). Thus, expect a delay (a tolerable delay)
each time that white moves in this latter game.
If you run roundrobin with the current code (minmax with no pruning),
then be prepared to wait quite a while. The following will eventually
materialize (which I have indented for a bit better readability):
random wins=1 boards=0        || diff/1 wins=9 boards=1824
random wins=2 boards=0        || diff/3 wins=8 boards=174938

wdiff/1 wins=0 boards=2311    || wdiff/3 wins=10 boards=292058
wdiff/1 wins=1 boards=1944    || wdiff/5 wins=9 boards=29422051
wdiff/3 wins=1 boards=234330  || wdiff/5 wins=8 boards=28452315
Each line above shows the results of 10 matches against two strategies.
For example, the last line shows the results of the strategy using
3-ply lookahead with weighteddiffeval (wdiff/3) as the utility function
against 5-ply lookahead with the same utility function (wdiff/5). 
Over 10 games, wdiff/5 wins 8, wdiff/3 wins 1, and there is one tie.
Over 10 games, wdiff/5 (in this last case) generates 28,452,315 boards 
(or an average of 2,845,232 boards generated per game)!
If and when you were to implement an incomplete (local)
alphabeta pruning running, the results will be
something like:
random wins=1 boards=0      || diff1 wins=9 boards=1824
random wins=2 boards=0      || diff3 wins=8 boards=44887
random wins=0 boards=0      || diff5 wins=10 boards=944422
random wins=3 boards=0      || wdiff1 wins=7 boards=2455
random wins=1 boards=0      || wdiff3 wins=9 boards=97418
random wins=0 boards=0      || wdiff5 wins=10 boards=2839502
diff1 wins=0 boards=1799    || diff3 wins=10 boards=44741
diff1 wins=0 boards=1763    || diff5 wins=10 boards=1038063
diff1 wins=4 boards=2134    || wdiff1 wins=6 boards=2397
diff1 wins=2 boards=2038    || wdiff3 wins=7 boards=90605
diff1 wins=0 boards=1736    || wdiff5 wins=10 boards=2643711
diff3 wins=3 boards=59175   || diff5 wins=6 boards=1160722
diff3 wins=3 boards=51624   || wdiff1 wins=7 boards=2301
diff3 wins=1 boards=58869   || wdiff3 wins=9 boards=84970
diff3 wins=1 boards=48521   || wdiff5 wins=9 boards=2947041
diff5 wins=2 boards=1142881 || wdiff1 wins=8 boards=2383
diff5 wins=4 boards=1063738 || wdiff3 wins=5 boards=76715
diff5 wins=0 boards=1124236 || wdiff5 wins=10 boards=2683518
wdiff1 wins=0 boards=2311   || wdiff3 wins=10 boards=89526
wdiff1 wins=1 boards=1944   || wdiff5 wins=9 boards=2635355
wdiff3 wins=1 boards=80708  || wdiff5 wins=8 boards=2844060
Notice that the win/loss results do not change at all (minmax
with alphabeta pruning chooses exactly the same moves as
minmax without alphabeta pruning), but the number of generated
boards is vastly reduced. For example, when wdiff5 is
pitted against wdiff3, wdiff5 with pruning generates 2,844,060 
boards over 10 games or an average of 284,406 boards per game, as
opposed to about 10 times this without pruning. 
Results immediately above are from incomplete alpha-beta
pruning that we discussed in class. If you are careful to select 
the full alpha beta procedure (also discussed
in class) that is in the text, here is a list of results
that you might expect. This version communicates the best and worst
move scores (alpha and beta) across multiple levels of the minmax
search. In contrast, the incomplete version of alphabeta only
communicated the alpha and beta values (best or worst scores discovered
so far) to the immediate children of a node. Note that the results
below indicate a further decrease in number of boards expanded
(e.g., an average of 201,482 boards per game, down from 284,406, for wdiff5
when pitted against wdiff3)
Full alpha beta (no randomization of moves)

When you randomly select amongst the best moves in the minmax function,
you can expect different results than the above. In general, this
may represent a modest degradation in performance (in terms of
Win/Loss for what we regard as the better player) as well
as number of boards expanded. This degradation may be an artifact
of the randomization process and the fact that we are only playing
10 games per pairs of players in the roundrobin tournament, but there
may also be a more systematic bias at work here, which we will
discuss.
